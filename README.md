# SAP-CPI-ErrorHandlingWithOpenAITrello

### **Project Overview: SAP CPI Integration for Product Query and Automated Error Analysis**

This project is built in **SAP Cloud Platform Integration (SAP CPI)** and is designed to query product information. The main objective is not only to handle data integration but also to **intelligently analyze and manage process errors** using **OpenAI** and **SAP Process Director**.

---

### **Process Flow**

1. **Product Query Integration (iFlow)**
    
    - The main iFlow is responsible for querying product data from a source system or API.
        
    - During normal execution, it retrieves and processes product details successfully.
        
2. **Error Handling with Groovy Script**
    
    - If an error occurs during the execution of the iFlow, a **Groovy Script** is triggered.
        
    - This script captures detailed error information such as:
        
        - Error message and stack trace
            
        - iFlow name and ID
            
        - Timestamp and context data
            
3. **Error Analysis via OpenAI**
    
    - The captured error message is then sent to **OpenAI’s API** for analysis.
        
    - OpenAI processes the description of the error and returns a **diagnostic summary**, suggesting potential **root causes** and **possible solutions**.
        
4. **Automated Issue Management with Process Director**
    
    - Based on OpenAI’s response, another iFlow is triggered.
        
    - This second iFlow communicates with **SAP Process Director** to automatically:
        
        - **Create a new card (incident ticket)** containing:
            
            - The OpenAI-generated analysis of the error
                
            - Key iFlow data (name, execution details, timestamp, etc.)
                
        - **Generate a checklist** within the card, listing possible **resolution steps** derived from OpenAI’s suggestions.

### **Key Benefits**

- **Proactive Error Management**: The system not only detects but also analyzes integration errors automatically.
    
- **AI-Powered Insights**: OpenAI helps provide human-like reasoning to understand and resolve issues faster.
    
- **Automated Workflow**: The integration with SAP Process Director ensures that issues are tracked and actionable items are created without manual intervention.
    
- **Continuous Improvement**: The checklist generated helps build a repository of common issues and solutions, improving future maintenance and support efficiency.
